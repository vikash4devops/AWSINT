                "Effect":"Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS":"*"
                },
                "Action":"s3:GetObject",
                "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname/*"
            }
            ]
        }

    iii) select Effect (Allow / Deny)
    iv)  Principal (user arn who policy Generate for)
    v)   Actions (What actions user can be performed)
    vi)  Add Statement & Generate Policy
    vi)  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) - Bucket ARN, eg - arn:aws:s3:::bucketcsv17jan (put * (/*) so that policy will apply for all objects of this bucket)

    EG. POLICIES

    {
        "Id": "Policy1611983140022",
        "Version": "2012-10-17",

            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucketcsv17jan/*",
