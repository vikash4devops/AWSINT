----------------------------------- S3 BUCKETS TYPES --------------------------------

1) OBJECT STORAGE (S3 Standard)
    a) can store any types of data ie. -> music, text, sql, video etc. as a single object.
    b) object data's name should be globaly unique (unique name).

2) S3 INFREQUENT ACCESS (IA) :- it is a bit costly then S3 common storage while retrieving, but it is less costly for keeping data. So if data is not frequently retrievable, it can be used.

3) S3 ONE-ZONE 
    a) we can keep data which is not very much important, because, AWS doesn't keep its other 2 copies in this service (generally, AWS keeps 2 other data's copies in different AZs in other S3 Services).
    b) because of one zone data only, it costs less than others.

4) S3 EFS (ELASTIC FILE SYSTEM)

5) S3 EBS (ELASTIC BLOCK STORAGE) 
    a) it stores as divided data as chunk part data (block part) and it connected with ec2 machine.
    b) block storage doesn't contain metadata of each block indexes, but it keeps whole data's metadata. (METADATA -> about filesize, filename, filetype, file origin etc.)

6) S3 GLACIER -> it used to store big unused (not frequently used, 1-2 times in year) data, it costs too low.

7) S3 DEEP GLACIER -> it used to store big unused (not much frequently used, 1-2 times in 1-2 years) data, it costs too low.
    a) it charges as per GB while retrieving data (no charge while uploading), so if it used as stardard S3 bucket (very frequently), then charges will be high (as per GBs)

8) S3 SNOWBALL -> Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of the AWS cloud.
