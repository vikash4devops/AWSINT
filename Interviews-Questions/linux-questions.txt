1)    How to check Memory space

      free -h


2)    How to replace a particular keyword from a file from command line.

      sed -i s/o/r/g file.txt

      eg. sed -i s/original_key/replaced_with/g

      sed = stream editor, i = in-place, s = substitue, o = original, r = replaced with, g = globally

4)    How to check nginx syntax if its ok or error
      
            nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf -t         (-c is configuration file and -t is test flag)
            
         
5)   What is Inode in linux?
      
      Inode is indexing of every file and directory, it keeps records of files and folders ie. file type, file size, location etc...
      so whenever a file or directory creates the inode also creates automatically.
      
  
6)   How to check Inode list
      
      df -i
      
     
7)    What is Soft link & Hard Link in linux?

       Soft Link & Hard link is a pointer of an original file where we can make a kind of shortcut to access the original file.
       using this links we create a kind of copy of original file, so whenever we write or update anythin in original file
       it will auto update the linked file.
       
       a) Soft Link
       
           command to create: ln -s original_file_path soft_link_path
           
          Imp*:- soft link Inode and original file Inode is different, so if the original file gets deleted the soft link file 
                  become useless and it delete the orignal file details.
            
            
       b) Hard Link
            
            command to create: ln original_file_path hard_link_path
            
            Imp*:- hard link Inode and original file Inode is same, so if the original file gets deleted the hard link file 
                   details does not delete it stay persist.
                   
               
8)    How to check Inode number of a file
      
      stat filename
      OR
      ls -i (list all file/folder inode numbers)
      
   
9)    How to disable/enable password authentication in ssh 

      /etc/ssh/sshd_config          #PasswordAuthentication yes_or_no
      &
      sudo restart ssh

11)   Load Average in Linux

      Load average is static of CPU utilization and loadings, it gives 3 statics ie. 0.12, 1.54, 2.45 
      (first static is CPU average load for last 1 minute, second is for last 5 minutes, third is for last 15 minutes)
      here 1 calculates as 100% for single core CPU, if its double core CPU, then it will be calculated as 50%, so 
      load average depends upon CPU cores, suppose we single core CPU and load average is 1 then its 100% loaded and other request will be on queue.
      
      * Below are the commands to get load average -
         a) top
         b) cat /proc/loadavg
      
      * Below command to check how many CPU cores in machine -
            cat /proc/cpuinfo
      

12)   How to change a user home directory
      
      use below command to change
      
            usermod -d newpath/username username
       
       now, list the user and check the home dir.
       
            cat /etc/passwd
            

13)   How to kill a process

      So, the purpose of kill any process is if it does not stop after a certain request or process then we need to kill that process forcefully,
      so, there are 64 ways of killing the process for different purposes.
      
      command to check the ways of kill processes
            kill -l           (will list all 64 kill processes)
            
      eg of kill process:- lets create a sleep process by command which runs in background, and will kill that
      
            sleep 500 &       (& used to run process in background)
            
        now, list of the running processes
        
            ps -l             (it list all running process with uid, pid, ppid, lets eg sleep process pid is 320)
            
        kill the process
        
            kill 320          (it will terminate the sleep process)

      when we use kill command to kill process it use 15th number of killing process which terminates the process from terminal,
      if the process still does not delete then we can use 9th number of killing process which will called to directly kernal 
      and process will be killed anyhow.
      
      
14)   How to check a file/folder size in linux?
            
            du -sh /file_or_folder_name


15)   List the files/folders which is modified 20 days ago or within.

            find . -mtime +20             (will list the files modified 20 days ago..)
            find . -mtime -20             (will list the files modified within 20 days)
