ELB :- ELASTIC LOAD BALANCER;

1) Load Balancer distribute the web traffic to the available servers, this is a region specifc (it handles only single region at once).

2) Three (3) Types of Load Balancer :- (i) Application Load Balancer, (ii) Network Load Balancer, (iii) Classic Load Balancer

    i)   Application LB :- (works on 7th Layer) this increase the availability of applications (i.e fast application), it supports protocols - HTTP/HTTPS
    ii)  Network LB     :- (works on 4th Layer) this LB used when there are multiple request in single time, it handles very effectively the multiple requests and response quick, it supports - TCP/UDP/TLS
    iii) Classic LB     :- (works on 4th & 7th Layer both) it supports protocols - HTTP/HTTPS/TCP/SSL, and - IPV4, IPV6 & DUAL


3) How Load Balancer Works :- it generates DNS (a kind of public accessable IP Address) and it transffers the requests to connected ec2 private IP Addresses (only to connected ec2)   

4) ELB is hourly charable, eg if we use it for 10 minutes it charges for 1 hr.

5) If we delete the ELB :- those EC2 instances will not be deleted which created by ELB on different availability zones.

6) ELB can be connected with only single subnet in one Availability Zone.

7) Min 8 Ips must be for ELB, min of 8 IPs CIDR is  eg :- 127.0.0.0/27 (32-27 = 5 -> 2*2*2*2*2 = 32 IPs, 8 IPs are reserved for ELB, and other 5 reserved for AWS, so 19 IPs are available ).

8) HEALTHY & UNHEALTHY THRESHOLD :- it depends upon "Response time-out", "Health Interval Time", & "Periodic Range", eg given below
    :- eg, we have set "Response Time-Out" as 5s, "Health Interval Time" as 30s & "Range" as 3 :- Now, in every 30 Sec response will send via Ping (HTTP PING) and if for 3 consecutive times response doesn't come within 5 sec then THRESHOLD (EC2 machine) will considered as "UNHEALTHY".

9) Maximum 200 Target Group (per availability zone) can be associated in a group.

10) Listeners :- it is the process that checks for connection request, each Network ELB needs atleast one Listener to accept traffic.
