------------------------------------------------------------------------ ELASTIC BLOCK STORAGE ---------------------------------------------------------

--> EBS is Persitent storage, it does not delete the data even after deleting instances (need to uncheck the deletion option on instance termination).
--> EBS works in "Network attached storage (NAS)", means it stored in VPC level rather than Instance level.
--> in EBS, data stores in blocks part (in indexes form).

1) TWO  types of storage 
  
  a) Root/Boot Storage  => this is where instance's  OS installed. 
  b) Non Root Storage   => here, it stores only data volumes.
  
 2) one EBS volume can be attached with only one instance, it can't be attached with multiple instances at same time.
 
 3) EBS Volume and Instance must be within the same AVAILABILITY ZONE to attach.
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- EBS VOLUME TYPES ---------------------------------------------------------------
 
  * There are THREE types of EBS Volumes
 
  a) SSD (Solid State Drive) Type :- it is a bootable drive, here OS can be installed (root drive volume - C drive).
  
    i)    General Purpose SSD (gp2)             :-  this is default instance volume (8gb for free t2.micro).
          ->  performance measured in IOPS
          ->  high performance, low latency
          ->  volume size :- 1GB to 16TB
          ->  IOPS Ratio  :- 3 IOPS/GB upto 10,000 IOPS
          ->  Charges     :- $ 0.10 /GB /Month
          
    ii)   Provisioned IOPS (io1)
          ->  high performance, low latency
          ->  it is designed & used for large scale volumes storage, i.e large RELATION or NoSQL databases.
          ->  volume size :- 4GB TO 16TB
          ->  Charges     :- $ 0.125 /GB /Month
    
  b) HDD (Hard Disc Drive) Type  :- it is a non-bootable drive, here OS can't be installed (use to add additional volume- D/E/F drive).
  
    i)    Throughoutput (mbps) optimized HDD (st1)
          ->  performance measured in MBPS
          ->  used for frequently data access
          ->  used for Big Data, Data Warehouses ie. big data volume
          ->  volume size :- 500GB TO 16TB
          ->  Charges     :- $ 0.045 /GB /Month
          
    ii)   Cold HDD (sc1)
          ->  used for infrequently data accessed
          ->  lowest cost volume storage
          ->  volume size :- 500GB TO 16TB
          ->  Charges     :- $ 0.025 /GB /Month
  
  c) Magnetic Standard            :- it is a bootable drive, here OS can be installed (root drive volume - C drive)
          ->  (its kind of old volume type, by def. AWS doesn't reccommend it)
          ->  used for infrequently data accessed
          ->  volume size :- 1GB TO 1TB
 
 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- EBS SNAPSHOTS (copy of a volume) ---------------------------------------------------------------

1)  Maximum 5,000 EBS Volumes can be created in aws account.

2)  Maximum 10,000 EBS Snapshots can be created in aws account.

3)  EBS Volumes are AVAILABILITY ZONE Specific.

4)  EBS Snapshots are REGION Specific.

5)  EBS Snapshots are stored in S3 Bucket.

6)  New Volume can be created from EBS Snapshot (Across Region).

7)  EBS Volume size and its Snapshot size would be equal.

8)  If new EBS Volume is created from a Snapshot, then that creating EBS volume size must be equal or greater than Snapshot size.

9)  HOW to Migrate an EBS volume from one AZ-1 to another AZ-2.

    a)  take Snapshot of AZ-1 EBS Volume & create EBS Volume from that Snapshot in another AZ-2 (since Snapshots are REGION Specific).

10) we can take Non-Root EBS Volume Snapshot in Running State (Instance state)

10) we can't take Root EBS Volume Snapshot in Running State (Instance state), we must stop instance    



-------------------------------------------------------------------- EBS ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION ---------------------------------------------------------------

1)  Encrypted EBS Volume's Snapshot will also be Encrypted (vice-versa for un-encrypted).

2)  If a Snapshot is Encrypted and a new EBS Volume is created from that Snapshot, then EBS Volume will also be Encrypted (vice-versa for un-encrypted) .

3)  Encrypted & Un-encrypted volume can be attached in same instance.

4)  How to Encrypt an existing un-encrypted volume (non-root volume)

      a)  Create a new EBS Volume and mark that as encrypted and attach this volume to Running instance & copy old volume (un-encrypted) data to this new encrypted volume

      b)  2nd way
            ->  Take a Snapshot of un-encrypted (existing) volume.
            ->  make a copy of this new created Snapshot and mark as encrypted.
            ->  now create new EBS Volume by this newly encrypted Snapshot.
            ->  attach new encrypted volume to Running instance.  

4)  How to Encrypt an existing un-encrypted volume (root volume)

      a) Make AMI of intended instance and create new instance with this AMI, now mark as encrypted to root volume while creating instance.
